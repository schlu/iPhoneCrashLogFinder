h1. iPhone Crashlog Finder

h2. Purpose

An application that helps iPhone developers get crashlog files from users. Currently poorly tested on Mac OS 10.5/10.6. Please contact me if you can build a windows version, I would either like to include the source in this repo or a link in the installation section.

h2. Installation and Instructions

* Give your users this "url":http://github.com/schlueter/iPhoneCrashLogFinder/raw/master/dist/iPhoneCrashLogFinder_latest.zip
* They will be able to search for your application
* zip files button creates a zip file in the Documents directory and opens it in Finder
* Then they can email that zip file to you

h2. Limitations

The UI doesn't work exactly as you would expect. The table rows aren't selectable, pull requests welcome :) I am an iPhone developer with *no* Mac OS development experience, please be constructive with your criticisms (but please send them).
